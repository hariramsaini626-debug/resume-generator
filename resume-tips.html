<h1>Resume Tips for Students</h1>
<p>A resume is the first impression of a student in front of any employer. A clean and well-structured resume increases your chances of getting selected.</p>
<p>Students should highlight their education, technical skills, projects and personal achievements instead of focusing on job experience.</p>
<p>Use simple fonts, avoid spelling mistakes and keep the resume limited to one page.</p>
<p>Our Resume Generator website helps students create professional resumes in just a few clicks without any registration.</p>
